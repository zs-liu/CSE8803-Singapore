\section{Response to the comments of our milestone report}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We add a title for the project.
	\item We add a SIR ODE model fitting the Singapore data to figure out the range of parameters and perform the calibration in a larger period with more parameters in this project. See the section \ref{sec-ode} for details.
	\item We use optuna to do the calibration in this project on first outbreak and second outbreak of Singapore separately in the period from last year to this years. Calibration details are discussed in section \ref{sec-cal}.
